==================================== HOW TO PLAY ====================================
Use the WASD keys to move

Use the mouse to aim & click to shoot

Use space bar to fire a special arrow that pierces enemies and does double damage

You must wait for your special attack to charge before using (purple bar on bottom)

The upper right corner shows health, damage, and enemies remaining

Kill all the enemies to finish the round

Once the round finishes you will have the opportunity to upgrade a stat

After each round more enemies spawn and they get faster, do more damage, and have more health (harder the difficulty the more speed, damage or health they gain)

Survive as many rounds as possible!
